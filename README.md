## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. For authentication, open a second terminal, navigate to `/server/` and run `node server` or `nodemon server` if nodemon is installed. This will run the backend required to validate login credentials and manipute data.
